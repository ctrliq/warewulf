We (like almost all open source software providers) have a documentation dilemmaâ€¦ We tend to focus on the code features and functionality before working on documentation. And there is very good reason for this: we want to share the love so nobody feels left out!

You can contribute to the documentation by [raising an issue to suggest an improvement](https://github.com/hpcng/warewulf/issues/new) or by sending a [pull request](https://github.com/hpcng/warewulf/compare) on [our repository](https://github.com/hpcng/warewulf).

The current documentation is generated with [Docusaurus](https://v2.docusaurus.io/docs/).

For more information on using Git and GitHub to create a pull request suggesting additions and edits to the docs, see the [section on contributing to the code](contributing). The procedure is identical for contributions to the documentation and the code base.
